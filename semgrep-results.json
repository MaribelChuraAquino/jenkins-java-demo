    ❯❱ problem-based-packs.insecure-transport.js-node.using-http-server.using-http-server
          Checks for any usage of http servers instead of https servers. Encourages the usage of https       
          protocol instead of http, which does not have TLS and is therefore unencrypted. Using http can lead
          to man-in-the-middle attacks in which the attacker is able to read sensitive information.

   ❯❯❱ javascript.lang.security.detect-child-process.detect-child-process
          Detected calls to child_process from a function argument `req`. This could lead to a command  
          injection if the input is user controllable. Try to avoid calls to child_process, and if it is
          needed ensure user input is correctly sanitized or sandboxed.
